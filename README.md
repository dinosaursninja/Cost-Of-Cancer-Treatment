Cost Of Cancer Treatment
Long term, I would like to group the cancer by types and see how the cost of treatment compares amongst the groups, particularly for breast cancer vs glioblastoma.

Short term for this assignment I would like to compare the standard deviation for the three columns (initial cost, contuinuing cost and last year of life) 
to see how the phases compare from one phase to another in terms of cost.
